## Recommended Readings:
### 1) Goethe's Faust
[Walter Kaufmann Translation](https://www.amazon.com/Johann-Wolfgang-Von-Goethe-11-4-1962/dp/B00HTKDSIA)<br/>
--> In this classic masterpiece, we find Dr. Faust, a middle-aged scholar and scientist who has promised the devil his soul in exchange for finding the true meaning of life. It took the German poet, Goethe, his whole life to complete this poem. And the poem does show how Goethe's way of thinking evolved as he aged from the time he began writing it at age 20, until he finished it just before he passed away at 83.<br>
<br>If you haven't read it, or have yet to hear the story, consider this: if you were given a choice to live any life you want, e.g. become the wealthiest, be loved by anyone, become the most powerful, and in exchange, you\'ll have to die, would you take it?

### 2) Dante Alighieri's La commedia: Inferno
--> reminder: La commedia (COMEDY) = NOT TRAGEDY;<br/>
--> however, NOT immediately = FUNNY;<br/>
--> +La commedia: Purgatorio, Paradiso<br/>
--> reminder: In JOURNEY, select PEOPLE stuck in Inferno,<br/>
--> With Optimistic View due La commedia, only DELAYED to Paradiso
