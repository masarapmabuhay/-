#### Example Notes

> The Science and Art of Defining Your Health<br/>
> 
> @xxii~xxiii (Foreword)<br/>
> Heart disease accounts for nearly 1/3 of all deaths worldwide<br/>
> --> preventive medicine; due to cost-effective as Return-on-Investment (RoI)<br/>
>
> Example: Heart Attack Treatment COST >= 10,000's of USD<br/>
> --> execute: Tests + Medical DRUG COST = 200USD (approx)<br/>
>
> Dagdag:<br/>
> --> Pumunta ka sa Palengke; puso ng BABOY; pigain mo iyon;<br/>
> --> Ang mga buu-buong dugo, 'yan ang bumabara sa ugat;<br/>
> --> Sanhi: mga TABA (FATS) mula sa BABOY, atbp na hirap sunugin sa katawan; kulang na sa pagkilos  
> --> Dulot nito: stroke, heart attack<br/>
>
> @40 (What is Health?)<br/>
> protein: creates language of our bodies, language of health<br/>
> DNA static; proteins dynamic due to has INFORMATION on "state" of body<br/>
>
> @115~116 (Two French Restaurants, One Without Butter)<br/>
> understand behavior of "whole" via interaction among its parts<br/>
> Example: Whole Body; interaction of genes, proteins, molecules that play a defining role<br/>
> 
> HISTORY <br/>
> engineering evolution: control complex systems without necessarily understanding them<br/>
> medicine: understanding, but NOT yet controlling<br/>
>
> Example: Sun Microsystems (now ORACLE)<br/>
> --> In the Year 2009, CAN predict the faulty component to cause system failure<br/>
> 
> Medicine Application Example:<br/>
> observed: pattern in X proteins, <br/>
> --> output: problem Y, drug Z would help <br/>
>
> Glucose = sugar molecule (chief source of energy), drives cellular metabolism<br/>
> Proteins = regulate production and breakdown of molecules<br/>
>
> @162 (The Elements of Healthy Style)<br/>
> original premise of book: BODY is complex system<br/>
> CHANGE in one variable will have many effects in system<br/>
> --> we have yet to develop technology to fully comprehend<br/>
>
> @228 (The Elements of Healthy Style)<br/>
> exercise to reverse aging<br/>
>
> @230 (The Elements of Healthy Style)<br/>
> short bursts v.s. marathons<br/>
> --> prefers: short bursts <br/>
> --> 6hrs >= sitting causes health problem<br/>

## Recommended Action:
1) learn: to quickly identify the CORE IDEA of READINGS;<br/>
where: CORE IDEA as applied in your LIFE;<br/>
2) share: with public your NOTES<br/>
--> reminder: There exists the following ACTION:<br/>

--> <b>FROM Class Essays Notes TO BOOK Publication TO U.S.A. Senate Candidate</b><br/>
--> https://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup; last accessed: 20220507; from 20220426<br/>
--> <b>Recommended Action:</b> verify OUTPUT after school graduation IF person did learn;<br/>
--> classifies: graduates who execute ACTIONS, e.g. smuggling, carnapping,<br/> 
--> despite passing school EXAMINATIONS to have NOT learned;<br/> 
--> passed due to <b>CHEATING</b>;<br/>

### Example
Example.1) Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (Author)'s [Maxims and Reflections (Penguin Classics)](https://www.amazon.com/Maxims-Reflections-Penguin-Classics-Wolfgang/dp/0140447202)<br/>
--> [gutenberg.org ELECTRONIC BOOK version](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33670/33670-h/33670-h.htm)<br/>

<b>Example NOTES</b>
> observed: self to have STOPPED after quickly verifying "Maxims and Reflections"<br/>
> --> due to LIST of IDEAS classified to be TRUTH without example from the author<br/>
>
> Example: "28; Love of truth shows itself in this, that a man knows how to find and value the good in everything."<br/>
>
> --> remembers: recommendation by Ernest Hemingway to begin a story with a sentence that is TRUE;<br/>
> --> add: examples via continuation of story;<br/>
>
> reminder: NO NEED to use available TIME executing verifications, IF CORE IDEA already CLEAR;

3) learn: to write instructions for computer automation BOTS to assist in <b>QUICKLY</b> and <b>CORRECTLY</b> counting transactions<br/>
--> where: counting : Maparaang Pagbibilang<br/>
--> <b>Example:</b> [Knowledge Management System (KMS)](https://github.com/usbong/KMS)<br/>

--> <b>reminder#1:</b> computer instructions contain the techniques as steps to be auto-executed<br/> 
--> <b>reminder#2:</b> literature, e.g. from books, Terms and Conditions, Agreement, also contain techniques
