Sumasayaw na bata<br/>
<br/>
keyphrase: 足 (あし) = PAA; <br/>
reminder: "to DRAG FEET" signifies LAZY to WORK via CORRECT physical movement<br/>
--> where: WORK : unti-unting pagkita ng pera mula sa paghahanap-buhay<br/>
--> where: in Physics (物理; ぶつり), WORK = MASS * ACCELERATION * DISTANCE<br/>
--> where: FORCE = MASS * ACCELERATION

## Recommended Actions:
### increase: know-how of CAN-DO Tasks
--> where: Tasks usually requested to be received from another person<br/>
--> where: Tasks during learning TIME may NOT yet immediately cause INCOME

### Examples:
### 1) learn: SCIENCE of SOUND 
--> where: SCIENCE keyphrase: CORRECT, identification, classification<br/>

### Reminder on SOUND
--> In Physics, we learn that sound carries energy.<br/>
--> That energy hits our eardrums when the sound as wave enters our ears.<br/>
--> A sufficient amount of energy can physically hurt our eardrums.<br/>
--> We know the amount of energy is sufficient because we already feel pain.<br/>
--> This leads to loss of hearing, which further leads to falling to the ground due to being off balance.

### 2) learn: Replication of Sound as Music; Speed-up Technique:
<b>Steps:</b></br>
2.1) get: TOOL, e.g. YAMAHA electronic keyboard<br/>
<br/>
2.2) get: >= one (1) MUSIC key of target TUNE of MUSIC to learn<br/>
--> IF output TUNE NOT similar or exact to target MUSIC, re-verify TOOL

### 3) learn: Swimming Techniques as CORRECT Physical Exercise
--> This is instead of QUICK Movement from START to END POINTS;<br/>
--> Example: Backstroke;<br/> 
--> where: breathing with arms rotation movement technique is KEY
